1 IntroductionWelcome to the first ECE 411 Machine Problem! In this MP you will verify and debug designs for several hardware components. Additionally, you will design a hardware component using test-driven design methodology. This document contains the design specifications required to complete these tasks.The primary objective of these exercises is to introduce you to hardware verification methodologies using SystemVerilog which you will use for the more complicated hardware designs found in follow on MPs. Additionally, you will learn how to verify and/or design the following hardware components:• An eight-bit multiplier• A synchronous FIFO• A content addresable memory (CAM)• A parallel input, serial output sequencerThe remainder of this section describes some notation that you will encounter throughout this tutorial. Most of this notation should not be new to you; however, it will be worthwhile for you to reacquaint yourself with it before proceeding to the tutorial itself. Section 8 covers the simulation of the design using ModelSim. Section 9 contains the items you will need to submit for a grade. Also included are several appendices that contain additional useful information.As a final note, read each and every word of the tutorial and follow it very carefully. Careful attention to how signal values are assigned and sampled is key to passing the verification assignments. If you do decide to work on the MP before finishing the documentation, make sure to see Sections 8 and 9 for instructions on running the simulation software and submitting your MP for grading, respectively.1.1 NotationThe numbering and notation conventions used in this tutorial are described below:• Indexing into arrays is based on the dimensions of the array. For example, in bit [7:0] arr1, ‘bit 0’ refers to the rightmost bit of arr1, while in bit [0:7] arr2, ‘bit 0’ refers to the leftmost bit of arr2.• Numbers beginning with 0x are hexadecimal.• For RTL descriptions, pattern[x:y] identifies a bit field consisting of bits x through y of a larger binary pattern. For example, X[15:12] identifies a field consisting of bits 15, 14, 13, and 12 from the value X.• Commands to be typed at the terminal are shown as follows:$ commandDo not type the dollar sign; this represents the prompt displayed by the shell (e.g., [<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="83ede6f7eae7c3efeaedf6fbaee2b1">[email protected]</a> ~]$).• Filenames are shown in italics.• SystemVerilog keywords are displayed as keyword.• Signal identifiers are shown in fixed_width.• Signal identifiers are written in “snake case” (lower case with underscores seperating words). Additionally, identifiers will include one or more suffix:– Port input signals are suffixed with ‘_i’.– Port output signals are suffixed with ‘_o’.– Port inout signals are suffixed with ‘_io’.– Signals which are synthesized into registers are suffixed with ‘_r’.– Signals which are used to wire components within a module are suffixed with ‘_w’.– Signals which are ‘active low’ are suffixed with ‘_n’.– SystemVerilog interface signals are suffixed appropriately to show the driver of the signal and, if there is only one consumer, the consumer. For example, if the ‘Master’ port is the driver of a signal, and the ‘Slave’ port is the consumer, then the signal will use the suffix ‘_m_s’.– A parameter identifier is suffixed with ‘_p’.– A localparameter identifier is suffixed with ‘_lp’– Signals may concatenate multiple suffixes as necessary.• All SystemVerilog function, task, module, interface, modport, and class identifiers use either ‘snake case’ or ‘camel case’.• SystemVerilog macro identifiers are written in UPPER_CASE and do not have a prefixed underscore.• Actions to take in the GUI are shown in bold.2 GettingStarted2.1 Creating a Github RepositoryTo create your git repository, goto https://edu.cs.illinois.edu/create-ghe-repo/ece411-fa19/ to create your repository.Next, create a directory to contain your MP files and execute the following commands (replacing NETID with your netid):$ git init$ git remote add origin <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ed8a8499ad8a849985988fc089889bc38e9ec3848181848382849ec3888998">[email protected]</a>:ece411-fa19/NETID .git$ git remote add release <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="43242a3703242a372b36216e2726356d20306d2a2f2f2a2d2c2a306d262736">[email protected]</a>:ece411-fa19/ _release.git$ git fetch release$ git merge –allow-unrelated-histories release/mp0 -m “Merging provided MP0 files”$ git push –set-upstream origin masterAlternatively, download the mp0 directory in the ‘_release’ repository and copy the files manually to your repository.3 WhatIsVerificationWhen designing a digital circuit in a hardware descriptor language (HDL), we are attempting to describe a hardware component whose behavior will comply with a high level description of an intended behavior (a specification). Hardware verification is a process which attempts to ensure that a design’s behavior matches a specified behavior.3.1 Verification Is HardDigital hardware verification is a hard problem. For example, consider the collection of Boolean functionsBn =©f ¯¯ f : {0,1}n → {0,1}ª.These are the functions with n binary inputs and a binary output.How would you go about writing a program which takes as input an element of Bn (the specification), and a SystemVerilog description of a digital circuit (the design), and outputs whether or not the design matches the specification? Can you come up with something significantly better than iterating through all 2n possible function inputs and ensuring that the output of the design matches the output of the specification?3.2 Verification Is NecessarySince verification is both hard and an integral part of hardware development, it figures that it must be important. Visit EDA Playground and JSFiddle and you’ll see that while EDA Playground by default gives as much screenspace to testbench development as design development, JSFiddle gives zero screenspace to debugging.We have all experienced buggy software where developers clearly prioritized getting a product to market over getting a product to work correctly.6 What makes hardware so different from most software in that thorough verification is considered necessary in industry?There are numerous reasons, including the following from Kropf:• fabrication costs are much higher for hardware than for software;• hardware bug fixes after delivery to customers are almost impossible; • quality expectations are usually higher for hardware than for software;• time to market severely affects potential revenue.[3, pg.3] In this excerpt, “quality expectatoins are usually higher” often means “human safety is at risk if this hardware device does not work properly”.For you, an ECE 411 student, verification is also important because your GPA will depend on succesfully verifying digital designs.3.3 Verification Is Not ValidationA similar but different process to verification is validation. Whereas verification is a process by which we ensure that a design matches its specification, validation is a process by which we ensure that a design matches a specification.Consider the case where a truck is designed to meet a specification of being able to haul twenty tons of material. The truck designers at ACME Truck Co. must verify that their trucks can haul twenty tons. Likewise, ACE Hauling Co. requires a truck which can haul twenty-two tons. Thus the engineers and technicians at ACE Hauling Co must validate that the ACME Truck Co.’s truck can haul twenty-two tons.3.4 How To Do VerificationThere are three central tasks to verification :1. Stimulate a design by providing sequences of stimuli;2. Check that the design outputs results in accordance with the specification;3. Measure how much of a design’s execution state space has been stimulated and checked.The way that you will complete these three tasks in this MP is by using dynamicsimulation. In this MP you will use specifications to generate (sometimes random) sequences of input stimuli, create software checkers which confirm that the output of the design under test (DUT) conform to the specification, and “scoreboard” DUT accuracy and coverage.3.5 A Simple Verification ExampleTo demonstrate dynamic simulation we can use the simple example of a purely combinational circuit:Our task is to verify that module purefunction, shown in Listing 1 (the design) actually implements the truthtable its description comment says it does. The truth-table is an example of a specification which describes the intended behavior of the circuit.Listing 1: A purely combinational design// Module implements the following truth-table:/*abc || x 000 || 0001 || 0011 || 1010 || 1110 || 0100 || 1101 || 0111 || 1*/module purefunction( input logic a_i, input logic b_i, input logic c_i, output logic x_o );assign x_o = a_i ^ b_i ^ (a_i &amp; c_i);endmodule : purefunctionIn a sense, combinational circuits are the simplest of digital circuits: they have no initial or intermediate state, the size of the input and the output are fixed, and the “runtime” is constant. To verify the design, we can simply run though all possible inputs and verify that the DUT generates the proper outputs:Listing 2: Generating Stimulusinitial beginfor (int i = 0; i &lt; 4’b1000; ++i) begin{a_i, b_i, c_i} = i[2:0];#1; endendNow that we’ve managed to generate all possible inputs, we must create a model of the specified behavior:Listing 3: Modeling the Proper Behaviorfunction logic spec_output(logic a, logic b, logic c); case ({a, b, c})3’b000: return 0;3’b001: return 0;3’b011: return 1;3’b010: return 1;3’b110: return 0;3’b100: return 1;3’b101: return 0; 3’b111: return 1;default: $error(“Invalid input to spec_output function”);endcase endfunctionHere we directly implement the specified truth table in something which resembles a MUX. In the case of combinational logic with more inputs, we could instead load the truth table into a memory indexed by the inputs as our specification model.Finally, we can rewrite the for loop which generates the input stimuli to check that the output of the DUT matches the output of the model:output_equiv: assert (x_o == spec_output(a_i, b_i, c_i))$error(“{a,b,c}=%b, dut output: %b spec output: %b”, {a_i,b_i,c_i},x_o,spec_output(a_i,b_i,c_i));end$finish; endPutting this all together, we can write our testbench to verify module purefunction:function logic spec_output(logic a, logic b, logic c); case ({a, b, c})3’b000: return 0;3’b001: return 0;3’b011: return 1;3’b010: return 1;3’b110: return 0;3’b100: return 1;3’b101: return 0; 3’b111: return 1;default: $error(“Invalid input to spec_output function”);endcase endfunctionmodule purefunction_tb; timeunit 1ns; timeprecision 1ns; logic a_i, b_i, c_i, x_o; purefunction dut(.*);initial begin reset = ’1;// Generate sequence of inputs for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 4’b0111; ++i) begin// Set input values to the dut, and let combinational logic settle{a_i, b_i, c_i} = i[2:0];#1; reset = ’0;// Check dut output vs specification output output_equiv: assert (x_o == spec_output(a_i, b_i, c_i)) else $error(“With {a, b, c}=%b, dut outputs: %b while spec outputs: %b”,{a_i, b_i, c_i}, x_o, spec_output(a_i, b_i, c_i));end$finish; endendmodule : purefunction_tbOur testbench generates sequences of input stimuli, uses these stimuli to drive the DUT as well as a software model of the specification, and compares the outputs of the two. Further, although we don’t explicitly measure it, our knowledge of the test stimuli generated and the execution state space ensures that we have full coverage of the design.3.6 Verifying a Sequential CircuitWhen verifying a circuit representation of a Boolean function, we can exhaust all possible inputs simply by iterating through each possible input combination. Consider the case of a sequential circuit, which takes arbitrarily large inputs serially. Clearly verifying the circuit by simply monitoring the input and output ports is insufficient, since the circuit can potentially process infinitely many different input “strings”. We consider such an example:Listing 5: A Sequential Circuit With Binary String Inputmodule div5( input logic clk, input logic rst, input logic serial_in, input logic run, output logic decision);logic [2:0] state;localparam logic [2:0] initial_state = ’1;always_ff @(posedge clk) begin if (rst) begin state &lt;= initial_state;end else if (run) begin case (state) initial_state,3’b000: state &lt;= serial_in ? 3’b001 : 3’b000;3’b001: state &lt;= serial_in ? 3’b011 : 3’b010;3’b010: state &lt;= serial_in ? 3’b000 : 3’b100;3’b011: state &lt;= serial_in ? 3’b010 : 3’b001;3’b100: state &lt;= serial_in ? 3’b100 : 3’b011; endcaseend else begin state &lt;= initial_state;endend assign decision = state == 3’b000; endmodule: div5Listing 5 is a SystemVerilog representation of a DFA which “decides” the language “DIV5”. If the input string is divisible by five, then on completion of input processing, the output port decision should be high. Similarly, if the input string is NOT divisible by five, then on completion of input processing, the output port decision should be low.Since there is no limit on how long input strings can be, if we test the functionality by looking only at inputs and outputs of the design module, then we can only give guarantees qualified by a certain input size (e.g. “all inputs of less than 16-bits produced the proper outputs”). Luckily, we can verify whether this design is functionally correct without qualifications. Instead of specifying that the design produces a certain output signal based on the sequence of input signals we instead specify that the design implements a specific DFA, which we prove decides the language DIV5. Thus we must simply verify that the design implements the DFA.The DFA that we implement has six states, five of which are labeled 0 through 4 which represent the value of the in-process input string modulus 5. The sixth state is the initial state, labeled s. The next state transition function, δ, which takes the current state i, and input bit b as follows .(= (2i +b) mod 5 i ∈ {0,1,2,3,4} δ(i,b) . b i = sAn input string is divisble by five if and only if the DFA moves to state 0 upon processing the last (least significant) bit in the bit string. We consider this DFA to consume its input string from left-to-right (i.e. the most significant bit first).18Thus to verify the design, we must move the design into every posible state it can enter, and then ensure the transitions from these states are correct.3.6.1 Coverage PointsThese “edges” — combinations of internal design state and input signals — are called “coverage points”. In this MP, you will be graded on your ability to write testbenches which reach these coverage points and ensure the correct behavior of the design at these points.3.7 Testbench ComponentsIn these prior examples, the verification steps of input stimulus generation, driving the DUT and model, comparing the results of the two are done using only the most basic buliding blocks of SystemVerilog: modules, arithmetic and logical operators, procedural flow-control, immediate assertions, functions, and the timestep delay operator (#). Additionally, it may be useful to seperate functionality of the verification proccess into multiple independent parts:• A ‘sequencer’ whose only responsibility is generating input stimuli, independent of the bus or interface used by the DUT.• A ‘driver’ which generates the bus or interface control input stimuli and transfers the sequencer’s data to the DUT.• A ‘monitor’, which acts like a mirrored image of the driver. Just as the driver transactionalizes input stimuli to send to the DUT, the monitor observes and collects the inputs and outputs of the DUT to identify when a transaction is complete and ready to be evaluated by the ‘scoreboard’.• A ‘scoreboard’ takes the output of the monitor and evaluates whether the DUT produced the appropriate value. In addition to evaluating correctness, the scoreboard can also measure testing coverage.Performing dynamic simulation of more complicated designs will often suggest using other SystemVerilog language features, such as object-oriented programming, and interprocess communication features . Further, other designs may have far too large of an execution state space to fully cover, and thus explicit cover points must be determined and tested for, while large portions of the execution state space may only be covered if randomized stimulus happen to check those states.In the ensuing exercises, you will see designs which you should be able to fully cover as we did for module purefunction, and designs whose execution state space is too large to fully cover.4 VerifyingaMultiplier4.1 Overview….For this exercise, you will write a testbench to verify an unsigned integer add-shift multiplier for use in an 8-bit computer. The multiplier is described in ./multiplier/hdl/multiplier.sv. In this exercise, you will design a test bench to verify this design.4.2 SpecificationThe multiplier has the following port listing:module add_shift_multiplier( input logic clk_i, input logic reset_n_i, input operand_t multiplicand_i, input operand_t multiplier_i, input logic start_i, output logic ready_o, output result_t product_o, output logic done_o);• clk_i is the clock which drives the sequential logic in the multiplier• reset_n_i is an active low, synchronous reset signal. If this signal is asserted at @(posedge clk_i), the multiplier should halt any ongoing multiplication and reset its state to allow for the start of a new multiplication.• multiplicand_i and multiplier_i are the input operands for the multiplication. When a multiplication begins, these signals are registered in the multiplier and thus are not required to be continuously asserted throughout the multiplication.• start_i begins a new multiplication if it is asserted at @(posedge clk_i) and the multiplier is in a ‘ready’ state. If the multiplier is not in a ‘ready’ state, assertion of this signal has no effect.• ready_o asserts that the multiplier is in a ‘ready’ state and can begin a new multiplication.• product_o contains the 2 * width_p bit output of the multiplication when the multiplier is in a ‘done’ state.• ready_o is asserted when the multiplier is in a ‘done’ state. This occurs when multiplication is complete, meaning (product_o contains the product of the registered input operands OR a synchronous reset has occurred), AND a new multiplication has been started.See Figure 1 for a timing diagram depiction of this protocol. We do not specify how many cycles the multiplier takes to complete the multiplication.4.3 CoveragesYour testbench must cover at least the following:

Figure 1: Multiplier Timing Diagram• From a ‘ready’ state, assert start_i with every possible combination of multiplicand and multiplier, and without any resets until the multiplier enters a ‘done’ state (resets while the device is in a done state are acceptable);• For each ‘run’ state s, assert the start_i signal while the multiplier is in state s;• For each ‘run’ state s, assert the active-low reset_n_i signal while the multiplier is in state s;4.4 Error ReportingYour testbench must detect the following errors (defined in ‘types.sv’):• Upon entering the ‘DONE’ state, the output signal product_o holds an incorrect product, report a BAD_RPODUCT error;• If the ready_o signal is not asserted after a reset, report a NOT_READY error;• If the ready_o signal is not asserted upon completion of a multiplication,report a NOT_READY error.To report an error, pass the appropriate error type to report_error task defined in ‘testbench.sv’. An example is given in Listing 6.Listing 6: Reporting a BAD_PRODUCT errorassert (/* your assertion here */)else begin$error (“%0d: %0t: BAD_PRODUCT error detected”, ‘__LINE__, $time); report_error (BAD_PRODUCT);end4.5 Clocking BlocksIn SystemVerilog, clocking blocks are an abstraction used to capture precise timing information and allow the verification engineer to write verification code at the ‘cycle’ level. The clocking blocks allow you to specify input and output skews, but in this MP, they are only used to specify clocks. When using a default clocking construct, signals should be assigned using non-blocking assignments. Further, you can insert a delay of N cycles using the syntax ##(N). To delay until some condition holds, use the ‘if and only if’ keyword: @(&lt;clk&gt; iff &lt;conditon&gt;);.4.6 Driving SignalsIn order to facilitate autograding, your testbench should set signal values only at time 0 (the begining of an initial block) or using the tb_clk clock as described in section 4.5. Additionally, at time 0, your testbench must assert the reset_n_i signal.4.7 Sampling SignalsAdditionally, all time delaying constructs should be associated with this default clock. That is, they should either be of the form ##(n), which waits for n cycles with respect to the clocking block, or @(tb_clk [iff &lt;predicate &gt;]) which delays for a single cycle, or delays until ‘predicate’ is evaluated true with samples taken with respect to the clocking block. Using the default clocking block in these ways is vital to getting an accurate assessment.For example, the following are appropriate procedural blocks for your testbenchreset_n_i = 1’b1; // reset not initialized to active low 0@(posedge clk); // Using clk rather than tb_clkmultiplier_i = 32; // signal value set at rising edge of clockinitial reset_n = 0; // initialize reset signal initial begin##(5); // Ensure DUT is resetreset_n &lt;= 1; multiplicand_i &lt;= 16;multiplier_i &lt;= 32; // NBA: signals still have their initial values@(tb_clk); // Wait for clock signal (could use ’##(1)’)// Now, when the values get assignedendalways @() begin$display(“SystemVerilog Functions cannot block”); endand the following are inappropriateinitial beginendalways @(negedge clk) beginreset_n_i = 1’b0; multiplicand_i = 16;multiplier_i = 32; // Only use NON Blocking Assignments // with a clocking block @(tb_clk); end5 VerifyingaFIFO5.1 OverviewFor this exercise, you will write a testbench to verify a syncronous FIFO with a single enqueuer and a single dequeuer. A FIFO is called ‘synchronous’ when the enqueue clock and the dequeue clock are the same. The FIFO is described in ./fifo/hdl/fifo.sv. In this exercise, you will design a test bench to verify this design.5.2 SpecificationThe FIFO implements a valid-ready enqueue protocol, and a valid-yumi dequeue protocol, and has the following port listing:module fifo_synch_1r1w( input logic clk_i, input logic reset_n_i,// valid-ready input protocol input word_t data_i, input logic valid_i, output logic ready_o,// valid-yumi output protocol output logic valid_o, output word_t data_o, input logic yumi_i);• clk_i is the clock which drives the sequential logic in the fifo;• reset_n_i is an active low, synchronous reset signal. If this signal is asserted at @(posedge clk_i), the FIFO sets itself to ‘empty’;• The valid-ready protocol is:– data_i contains the enqueued data word;– valid_i is asserted by the enqueuer to enqueue data_i into the FIFO;– ready_o asserts that the FIFO is not full and has capacity to enqueue a word. The behavior when valid_i is asserted while the FIFO is full is undefined and should be avoided.• The valid-yumi protocol is:– valid_o asserts that the FIFO is not empty and that the value on data_o is the oldest word stored in the FIFO;– yumi_i is asserted by the dequeuer to signal to the FIFO that the word in data_o must be removed from the FIFOSee Figure 2 for a timing diagram depiction of these protocols.

Figure 2: FIFO Timing Diagram5.3 CoveragesYour testbench must cover at least the following for the FIFO with capacity cap_p:• You must enqueue words while the FIFO has size in [0, cap_p-1];• You must dequeue words while the FIFO has size in [1, cap_p];• You must simultaneously enqueue and dequeue while the FIFO has size in [1, cap_p-1].5.4 Error ReportingYour testbench must detect the following errors (defined in fifo/include/types.sv):• Asserting reset_n_i at @(tb_clk) should result in ready_o being high at @(posedge clk_i). If it is not, report the appropriate error.• When asserting yumi_i at @(tb_clk) when data is ready, the value on data_o is the CORRECT value. If not, report the appropriate error. Recall that asserting yumi_i when the FIFO is empty results in undefined behavior, so avoid doing this.To report an error, pass the appropriate error type to report_error task defined in fifo/hvl/testbench.sv. An example is given in Listing 7.Listing 7: Reporting a errorassert (/* your assertion here */)else begin$error (“%0d: %0t: %s error detected”, ‘__LINE__, $time, err.name); report_error (err);end5.5 Driving SignalsOnce again, only drive signals at time 0 or using non-blocking assignments syncrhonized using the default tb_clk. Only sample signals as described in Subsection 4.7.6 VerifyingaCAM6.1 OverviewFor this exercise, you will write a testbench to verify a content addressable memory, or CAM. A CAM can be thought of as similar to an associative array in computer programming, with the distinction that a CAM is of fixed size. A CAM, then, is a collection of key-value pairs, and supports read and write operations. When reading a CAM, a key is provided, and the CAM responds with the appropriate value, or a signal indicating that their is no value associated with the key in the CAM. On a write, both a key and a value are provided, and these get stored into the CAM.Since a CAM has a fixed number of entries , some type of ‘replacement policy’ must be used when writing to a full CAM. The replacement policy used by the CAM in this MP is the ‘least recently used’ (LRU) policy, which evicts (removes) the entry whose key was least recently used by a read or write.The CAM is described across several files in cam/hdl. In this exercise, you will design a test bench to verify this design.6.2 SpecificationThe CAM has the following port listing:module cam( input clk_i, input reset_n_i, input rw_n_i, input valid_i, input key_t key_i, input val_t val_i, output val_t val_o, output logic valid_o);• clk_i is the clock which drives the sequential logic in the CAM;• reset_n_i is an active low, synchronous reset signal. If this signal is asserted at @(posedge clk_i), the CAM resets itself to ‘empty’;• rw_n_i decides whether the operation is a read (if set to 1’b1) or a write (if set to 1’b0). This value has no effect on the CAM unless valid_i is asserted;• valid_i is asserted when a read or write operation is performed;• key_i is the key input used by both read and write operations;• val_i is the value input used by write operations;• val_o is the output value on reads;• valid_o is asserted by the CAM on reads to assert that the value in val_o is correct (that is, the CAM found a value associated with key_i).Write and read operations are serviced at the rising edge of clk_i. That is, the CAM updates its internal state (both key-value pairs as well as LRU metadata sequentially. Additionally, the CAM guarantees that val_o and valid_o show the correct value on a read at the rising edge of clk_i.6.3 CoveragesYour testbench must cover at least the following:• The CAM must evict a key-value pair from each of its eight indices;• The CAM must record a “read-hit” from each of its eight indices;• You must perform writes to the same key on consecutive clock cycles;• You must perform a write then a read to the same key on consecutive clock cycles.6.4 Error ReportingYour testbench must detect the following errors• Assert a read error when the value read from the CAM is incorrect.To report an error, pass the appropriate error type to itf.tb_report_dut_error task defined in cam/include/cam_itf.sv. An example is given in Listing 8.Listing 8: Reporting a error@(clk);assert (itf.val_o == val) else begin itf.tb_report_dut_error(READ_ERROR);$error(“%0t TB: Read %0d, expected %0d”, $time, itf.val_o, val); end6.5 Driving SignalsOnce again, only drive signals at time 0 or using non-blocking assignments syncrhonized using the default tb_clk. Only sample signals as described in Subsection 4.7.7 DesignaSerializerIn this assignment, you will design a Parallel-to-Serial converter which is able to pass the testbench file provided in piso/hvl/testbench.sv. A skeleton design file is provided in piso/hdl/piso.sv.The recommended way of approaching this is to start by writing only enough HDL code to pass the first test. Once the first test passes, add HDL code to pass the second test, etc. This portion of the MP is completely self-grading: if your design passes all of the tests in the testbench, it will receive full credit.8 ModelSimIn the base directory of each of the verification assignments, there is a Tcl file named run.do. To test your design, from the command line execute the following:• Load ModelSim in module$ module load altera/18.1-std• run ModelSim from its CLI$ vsim -c• run the Tcl file&gt; do run.do9 SubmissionThe ‘master’ branch of your repository is graded nightly. Ensure that any additional files you use are ‘include’ed in each testbench. Nightly autograder runs submit results into ‘_grade’ branch in your git repository.A DIV5DFABinary strings are defined recursively as either• The empty string, denoted as ², or• s0 — a binary string, s followed by the symbol ‘0’, or• s1 — a binary string, s followed by the symbol ‘1’.We define the length of a binary string w, notated as |w| as• |w|= 0 for w =²• |w|= 1+|s| for w = s0 or w = s1.To prove this DFA is correct, we will actually prove a stronger property: for any non-empty string, w, the DFA will halt in state k where k = w mod 5 where w is interpreted as a binary number.Proof. Let w be an arbitrary binary string. Assume, for every string x such that 1 ≤|x|&lt;|w| that the DFA described above halts in state k where k = x mod 5. There are four cases to consider.• Suppose w = 0. Then the DFA halts in state 0 = 0 mod 5.• Suppose w = 1. Then the DFA halts in state 1 = 1 mod 5.• Suppose w = x0 for some binary string x. Since |x| &lt; |w|, by the inductive assumption, the DFA is in state k = x mod 5. Thus, after processing w = x0 from left-to-right, the DFA is in stateδ(k,0) = (2k +0) mod 5= (2(x mod 5)) mod 5= 2x mod 5 = w mod 5.Thus the DFA halts in state w mod 5.• Suppose w = x1 for some binary string x. Since |x| &lt; |w|, by the inductive assumption, the DFA is in state k = x mod 5. Thus, after processing w = x1 from left-to-right, the DFA is in stateδ(k,0) = (2k +1) mod 5= (2(x mod 5)+1) mod 5= (2x +1) mod 5 = w mod 5.Thus the DFA halts in state w mod 5.Therefore the DFA halts in state w mod 5 for any non-empty binary string w.The above proof combined with the facts that the DFA only accepts in state 0, and that the start state is not accepting prove that the DFA accepts a binary string if and only if the binary number represented by that string is divisible by five.References[1] “Ieee standard for systemverilog–unified hardware design, specification, and verification language”, IEEE Std 1800-2017 (Revision of IEEE Std 1800-2012), pp. 1–1315, Feb. 2018.
